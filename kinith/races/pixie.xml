                "Petal Gowns and Acorn Caps are so last summer!"<br />
                - Rivergleam, Pixie Fashionista
            </p>
            <p class="flavor">
                Curious as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures and are always
                excited to make new friends; only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked can contain its innate curiosity.
                In truth those who wander through a pixie's glade might never see the creatures, perhaps hearing the occasional
                giggle, gasp, or sigh. When seen, Pixies generally wear doublets or flowing gowns made of silk that sparkle in
                the moonlight. Some dress in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of tiny woodland beasts. They take great pride
                in their regalia and beam with joy when they are complimented on their ensembles.
            </p>

            <h4>Physical Description</h4>
            <p>
                Being barely a foot tall, pixies resemble diminutive elves with gossamer wings like those of dragonflies or butterflies,
                bright as the clear dawn and as luminous as the full moonrise. Their skin, hair, and eyes come in shades of natural colors
                including the greens of the leaves and grass or the browns and bronzes of the dirt and trees and even spans into the
                reds and yellows of autumn.
            </p>

            <h4>Magical Faerie Folk</h4>
            <p>
                With their innate power of invisibility, pixies rarely appear unless they wish to be seen. In the Feywild and on the
                Material Plane, pixies etch patterns of frost on winter ponds and rouse the buds in springtime. They cause flowers to
                sparkle with summer dew and color the leaves with the blazing hues of autumn.
            </p>

            <h4>Pixie Dust</h4>
            <p>
                When visible, a shower of sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering trail of a shooting star. A mere
                sprinkle of pixie dust is said to be able to grant the power of flight, confuse a creature hopelessly, or send foes
                into a magical slumber. Only pixies can use their dust to its full potential, but these fey are constantly sought
                out by mages and monsters seeking to study or master their power.
            </p>

            <h4>Tiny Trickster</h4>
            <p>
                While the arrival of visitors piques their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves at first. They study
                the visitors from afar to gauge their temperament or play harmless tricks on them to measure their reactions. For example,
                pixies might tie a dwarf's boot together, create illusions of strange creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to
                lead interlopers astray. If the visitors respond with hostility, the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors
                are good-natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened and more friendly. The fey might even emerge and offer to
                guide their "guests" along with a safe route or invite them to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in their honor.
            </p>

            <h4>Opposed to Violence</h4>
            <p>
                Unlike their fey cousins, the sprites, most pixies abhor weapons and would sooner flee than get into a physical
                altercation with an enemy.
            </p>

            <h4>Pixies as Adventurers</h4>
            <p>
                As an adventurer, you are expected to face many threats, and such encounters will usually require violence to resolve.
                Think about why you, as a pixie, have chosen this path of necessary violence that few of your brothers and sisters have
                taken before. Was there a threat to your family that you were forced to confront? Has your curiosity about the world led
                you to partake in adventures that help you explore it? Are you simply and inscrutably a break in the mold?
            </p>

            <h4>Pixie Names</h4>
            <p>
                Traditional pixie names are no more than a combination of two pleasant-sounding nouns. It is sometimes impossible to
                distinguish a male pixie from a female by name alone if the pixie is given a traditional name, though some trends and
                patterns can be observed (for instance, names with "sun" are usually masculine and names with "moon" are usually feminine).
                Pixies tend not to place as much emphasis on masculinity or femininity as most other races, and as such, a pixie parent
                usually names his/her child with whatever name seems best, regardless of gender. Most pixie communities have no concept of
                surnames. Pixies will sometimes name their children after the non-pixie wanderers or adventurers that they come across.
                Though they favor names that sound whimsical, it isn't unheard of for a pixie to be named along the lines of Kildrak or Doug.
